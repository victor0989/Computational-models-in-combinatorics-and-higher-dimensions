# Computational-models-in-combinatorics-and-higher-dimensions
In this math and artificial intelligence project I list and construct new computational models with various states at the algebraic and geometric methods level in enumerative combinatorics.

#My concept is to create a mathematical model based on combinatorics and higher order dimensions and build new multidimensional models at a spatial and abstract level.

#You will find in the project three important tools that are mathematics, scikit and representations of combinatorics and higher order dimensions.
